Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Software Engineer based out of Chicago and a graduate of Actualize Coding Bootcamp. I began learning about code at a young age but it wasn't until recently that I decided to develop my passion into a career in technology. I've always had an affinity for problem-solving and there's no better feeling than when a solution comes together! My motto is that every new problem leads to a new lesson and I love applying those lessons in my personal projects and in my current role as a Teaching Assistant for the coding bootcamp. You can check out my journey in My Work Journal below to see new learnings and resources I've gathered along the way.<br>
<br> When I'm not coding, you can find me playing volleyball (indoor and beach), snowboarding in Wisconsin or camping out under the stars. I'm a big sports fan and after having been to championship parades for both the Cubs and the Blackhawks, I'm hoping the next one will be for my Chicago Bulls ü§û <br>
<br>Skills include Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and GraphQL. Some interesting projects I'm working on:<br>
- [My Personal Site](www.aakashsoni.com)
- Happy Gamblr (sports bet log/global odds tracker)
- MyHistory (find out what historical events happened on your birthday!)<br>
- NBA Trend Analyzer (statistics analyzer)<br><br>
